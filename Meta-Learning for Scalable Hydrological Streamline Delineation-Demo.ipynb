Despite advancements in machine learning, applying models across different geographies remains challenging. This paper investigates whether meta-learning techniques can enhance model performance in such scenarios. Meta-learning leverages knowledge from multiple source tasks to improve the performance of the target task, offering promise in enhancing machine learning models. By hypothesizing that each study area holds unique underlying knowledge, we aim to leverage this knowledge to improve overall model performance, thereby expanding the transferability of the final model.\n","\n","#### Keywords:\n","\n","Streamline Delineation, Hydrology, Convolutional Neural Networks, U-net Model, Meta-Learning, Machine Learning"],"metadata":{"id":"2TM_-A_qd0sZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Prepare the environment\n","\n","We install and download neccessary resources."],"metadata":{"id":"AO67k_EMgaah"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%pip install segmentation-models &> /dev/null\n","!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N-Jaro/segmentation_model_tutorial/main/unet_util.py\n","\n","# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75433717/module-keras-utils-generic-utils-has-no-attribute-get-custom-objects-when-im\n","# open the file keras.py, change all the 'init_keras_custom_objects' to 'init_tfkeras_custom_objects'.\n","# the location of the keras.py is in the error message.
